"# monorepoexample" 

1. Yarn command at the root folder of repository to make all dependency install.  <br /> `yarn`
2. Build individual workspace. Go to specific workspace and use"npm run build"
   example: <br />
             ` cd packages/workspace-b/ ` <br />
             ` npm run build ` <br />
            
3. Run in local developement:  <br />
    `cd packages/workspace-b` <br />
    ` npm run local` <br />
     
All code is just about just a basic idea how monorepo works and method for sharing code between repositories.
